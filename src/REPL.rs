/*
In this stage, you'll implement a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
The REPL

A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive loop that forms the core of a shell. It follows a repeating cycle:

    Read: Display a prompt and wait for user input
    Eval: Parse and execute the command
    Print: Display the output or error message
    Loop: Return to step 1 and wait for the next command

This cycle continues indefinitely until the shell process is terminated.

Your shell should follow this same cycle:

    Display the prompt $, then wait for a line of input.
    Print <command_name>: command not found for any command the user enters, like with the previous stages.
    Return to step 1.

For example, if the user types hello, your shell should print hello: command not found, then display the prompt ($) again.
Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

./your_program.sh

It will then send a series of commands to your shell:

$ invalid_command_1
invalid_command_1: command not found
$ invalid_command_2
invalid_command_2: command not found
$ invalid_command_3
invalid_command_3: command not found
$

After each command, the tester will verify that your shell:

    Prints the message <command_name>: command not found.
    Displays a new prompt ($) before the tester sends the next command

Notes

    The exact number of commands sent and the command names will be random.
    The loop should run indefinitely. The tester will terminate your program when the test is complete.

        let mut command = String::new();
        std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut command).unwrap();

        // check if the trimmed command is empty (user just pressed enter)
        if command.trim().is_empty() {
            continue; // skip to the next iteration of the loop
        }
        // print command not found message
        println!("{}: command not found", command.trim());
    }
}
